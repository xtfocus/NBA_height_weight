I proposed the NBA height and weight topic for the final assessment of the Data Visualization unit in Monash.

This school project demonstrated my ability to:
- crawl data from sports websites and synthesize data
- clean data
- create two interactive Shiny apps that also support on the fly t-tests

For more details and context of the project, read the introduction in the report pdf.

1. Visualize distribution of height

From the "final" directory, open the command line interface and launch the
app:

```bash
$ Rscript -e 'library(methods); shiny::runApp("dist_shinyapp/",
launch.browser = TRUE)'
```

This will open the app in the default browser.

2. PER and Height, Weight

From the "final" directory, open the command line interface and launch the
app:

```bash
$ Rscript -e 'library(methods); shiny::runApp("per_shinyapp/",
launch.browser = TRUE)'
```

This will open the app in the default browser.
